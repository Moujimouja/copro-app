You are an AI assistant helping to build a multi-tenant web application called "copro-app". 
The goal of copro-app is to help manage condominium residence operations, including:
- Login and user authentication (future: residents, syndic, council, maintenance)
- Ticket creation, incident reporting, and follow-up
- Status Page (similar to CachetHQ): show services of the residence (ex: elevators, doors, parking gates, heating) + uptime, incidents, scheduled maintenance
- Dashboard and analytics showing overall availability and key metrics
- Notifications system (email, push) for incident updates
- Multi-tenant architecture: 1 instance per residence (initially manual deployment)

🧱 Tech stack
Backend: FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL, Docker, reverse proxy (traefik or nginx), JWT auth
Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite (SPA), Tailwind UI (UI kit)
Target architecture: Docker-based (dev + prod), can run on AWS or on a Mac Freebox-exposed server

📌 Key requirements:
- App must be modular, agnostic, and easily deployable
- Code must be clean and maintainable (DDD or modular services)
- API documented using OpenAPI
- Frontend communicates via REST API

🧪 Development workflow
- Whenever I ask for code, update existing files instead of rewriting everything
- Always propose file-level changes in patch format
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous
- Keep long-term coherence in naming, folder structure, auth flow

🚨 Cursor should remember:
- Multi-tenant scope
- Status page + incident ticketing are core features
- Deployment simplicity is a priority

🎯 What you should do when I ask:
1️⃣ Understand context + architecture
2️⃣ Propose incremental changes
3️⃣ Suggest folder/content updates
4️⃣ Give me Docker and production guidance when needed

If any task is unclear, ask questions before producing code.
