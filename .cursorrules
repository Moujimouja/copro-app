You are an AI assistant helping to build a web application called "copro-app" for managing a single condominium residence.
The goal of copro-app is to help manage condominium residence operations, including:
- Login and user authentication (admin only for now, future: residents, syndic, council, maintenance)
- Admin interface for managing equipment (ServiceInstance) and their status
- Public incident reporting form (tickets) with QR code access
- Status Page (similar to CachetHQ): show services of the residence (ex: elevators, doors, parking gates, heating) + uptime, incidents, scheduled maintenance
- Ticket management: public can create tickets, admin reviews and can create incidents
- Dashboard and analytics showing overall availability and key metrics (future)
- Notifications system (email, push) for incident updates (future)

🧱 Tech stack
Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11), PostgreSQL 15, Docker, JWT auth with bcrypt (direct, not passlib)
Frontend: React 18 + Vite (SPA), no TypeScript yet (plain JSX)
Target architecture: Docker-based (dev + prod), can run on AWS or on a Mac Freebox-exposed server

📊 Data Models (SQLAlchemy)
- Copro: Single copropriété (one instance = one copro)
- Building: Buildings in the copro (A, B, 1, 2, etc.)
- ServiceType: Template service types (Ascenseur, Éclairage, Eau chaude, etc.)
- ServiceInstance: Actual equipment instances in buildings
- Ticket: Public incident reports (pending → admin reviews → approved/rejected)
- Incident: Official incidents created by admin
- User: Users with is_superuser flag for admin access

🔑 Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Admin account: username "admin", password "admin123" (created via script)
- Only admins can access /admin routes
- Public routes: /status, /report (no auth required)

📌 Key requirements:
- App is for ONE copropriété per instance (simplified, no multi-tenant)
- App must be modular, agnostic, and easily deployable
- Code must be clean and maintainable (DDD or modular services)
- API documented using OpenAPI (FastAPI auto-docs)
- Frontend communicates via REST API
- Mobile-friendly design (responsive)

🧪 Development workflow
- Whenever I ask for code, update existing files instead of rewriting everything
- Always propose file-level changes in patch format
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous
- Keep long-term coherence in naming, folder structure, auth flow
- Use bcrypt directly (not passlib) for password hashing
- CORS configured for localhost:5173 and localhost:3000

🚨 Cursor should remember:
- Single copropriété per instance (not multi-tenant)
- Status page + incident ticketing are core features
- Admin interface for equipment management is essential
- Public ticket form with QR code for easy access
- Deployment simplicity is a priority
- Use ServiceInstance (not old Service model) for equipment
- Admin routes require is_superuser = True

🎯 What you should do when I ask:
1️⃣ Understand context + architecture
2️⃣ Propose incremental changes
3️⃣ Suggest folder/content updates
4️⃣ Give me Docker and production guidance when needed
5️⃣ Remember: one copro per instance, admin-only management, public reporting

🔧 Available Scripts
- Create admin: `python -m app.scripts.create_admin` (creates admin/admin123)
- Seed copro: `python -m app.scripts.seed_copro` (creates sample copro with buildings/services)

If any task is unclear, ask questions before producing code.
